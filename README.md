# Royal Sky Zoo Website

I created this project for my grade 12 computer science course.

The project is a responsive website for a zoo that I made up. 

The website consists of over 20 different pages, including pages to purchase tickets and rate the website.

This website is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
